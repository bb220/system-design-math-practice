    question: "A REST API endpoint returns JSON payloads averaging 5 KB. If the server handles 10,000 requests/sec, how much outbound bandwidth is needed?",
    unit: "MB/s",
    acceptableRange: [30, 75],
    referenceAnswer: 50,
    explanation: "5 KB × 10,000 = 50,000 KB/s = ~50 MB/s",
    tip: "Multiply payload size by request rate, then convert units. 1 MB = 1,000 KB."

    question: "An API gateway rate-limits users to 100 req/sec. If you have 50,000 daily active users and each makes 200 requests/day spread over 8 active hours, what peak requests/sec should the gateway handle?",
    unit: "thousand req/s",
    acceptableRange: [0.2, 1.0],
    referenceAnswer: 0.35,
    explanation: "50,000 users × 200 req/day = 10M req/day. Over 8 hours = 10M / 28,800s ≈ 347 req/s. Peak is typically 2-3× average ≈ ~700-1,000 req/s.",
    tip: "Calculate average first (total requests ÷ active seconds), then multiply by a peak factor (2-3×)."

    id: 3,
    topic: "APIs",
    question: "A GraphQL API batches queries. Each batch averages 4 sub-queries, and each sub-query takes 15 ms to resolve (run in parallel). If the overhead per batch is 5 ms, how many batched requests/sec can one server thread handle?",
    unit: "requests/sec",
    acceptableRange: [30, 70],
    referenceAnswer: 50,
    explanation: "Each batch takes 15 ms (parallel sub-queries) + 5 ms overhead = 20 ms. 1,000 ms / 20 ms = 50 requests/sec per thread.",
    tip: "Parallel execution means you take the max sub-query time, not the sum. Then add overhead."

    question: "A PostgreSQL table has 500 million rows, each row is 200 bytes. How much disk space does the raw data need?",
    unit: "GB",
    acceptableRange: [60, 150],
    referenceAnswer: 100,
    explanation: "500M × 200 bytes = 100 × 10^9 bytes = 100 GB",

    question: "Your web app gets 100M page views/day. Each page view makes 3 API calls. If traffic is spread over 18 active hours, what's the average API calls/sec?",
    unit: "thousand req/s",
    acceptableRange: [3, 8],
    referenceAnswer: 4.6,
    explanation: "100M × 3 = 300M API calls/day. 300M / (18 × 3,600) = 300M / 64,800 ≈ 4,630 calls/sec ≈ 4.6K req/s",
    tip: "Total calls = page views × calls per view. Divide by active seconds (hours × 3,600)."

  // === CAP Theorem (2) ===
  {
    id: 10,
    topic: "CAP Theorem",
    question: "A CP (consistent + partition-tolerant) database requires quorum writes. In a 5-node cluster, a write needs acknowledgment from a majority before success. If each node-ack takes 10 ms (parallel), what's the minimum write latency?",
    unit: "ms",
    acceptableRange: [8, 15],
    referenceAnswer: 10,
    explanation: "Quorum = majority of 5 = 3 nodes. Since acks are parallel, you wait for the 3rd fastest response. With uniform 10 ms latency, minimum = 10 ms.",
    tip: "Quorum = ⌊n/2⌋ + 1. Parallel acks mean you wait for the k-th fastest, not the sum."
  },

    id: 11,
    topic: "CAP Theorem",
    question: "An AP (available + partition-tolerant) system allows eventual consistency. If the replication lag is 200 ms between 3 data centers, and a user reads immediately after writing, what's the probability of reading stale data if reads are randomly routed?",
    unit: "percent",
    acceptableRange: [50, 80],
    referenceAnswer: 67,
    explanation: "With 3 data centers, the write lands on 1 first. A random read has a 2/3 chance (~67%) of hitting a replica that hasn't received the update yet.",

    unit: "logins/sec",
    acceptableRange: [10, 24],
    referenceAnswer: 16,
    explanation: "Each hash takes 250 ms = 4 hashes/sec per core. 4 cores × 4 = 16 logins/sec.",
    tip: "1,000 ms / hash_time = hashes per core per sec. Multiply by core count."
  },

    id: 13,
    topic: "Auth & Security",
    question: "A JWT token is 800 bytes. Your service validates 5,000 tokens/sec. Each validation does an RSA-2048 signature check taking 0.1 ms. What % of a single CPU core does token validation consume?",
    unit: "percent",
    acceptableRange: [30, 75],
    referenceAnswer: 50,

    tip: "New connection rate = max concurrent connections / average connection duration."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    topic: "Load Balancers",
    question: "An L7 load balancer inspects HTTP headers, adding 0.5 ms latency per request. If it handles 20,000 req/sec, how many CPU-milliseconds per second does inspection alone consume?",
    unit: "ms",
    acceptableRange: [7000, 15000],
    referenceAnswer: 10000,
    explanation: "20,000 × 0.5 ms = 10,000 CPU-ms per second = 10 full CPU cores worth.",

    unit: "thousand ops/s",
    acceptableRange: [90, 140],
    referenceAnswer: 111,
    explanation: "Total = 10 × 100K = 1M ops/sec. After failure, 9 nodes share the load: 1M / 9 ≈ 111K ops/sec each.",

    unit: "thousand writes",
    acceptableRange: [4, 9],
    referenceAnswer: 6,
    explanation: "Replication lag of 3 sec means up to 3 sec of writes may not have reached secondary. But detection takes 5 sec, so total gap ≈ 3 sec of un-replicated writes. 2,000 × 3 = 6,000 writes lost.",
